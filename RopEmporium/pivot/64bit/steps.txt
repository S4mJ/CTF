fgets read is only 64 bytes and the buffer size + rbp is 40 bytes. We have 16 bytes for the ROP
move stack pointer using rop gadget xcgh eax, rsp; ret to heap. address of uVar is printed by program so we know wwhat to set rsp to.

need to call ret2win
call foothold function to fill its .got.plt
compute offset of foothold function and ret2win to know ret2wins address
set value of register 1 equal to got.plt of foothold function
set register 1 = register1(foothold_function) + register2(offset) = ret2win and call register 1
